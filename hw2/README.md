## Part 2

**Total Time Spent** : 1 hour

**Notes**:
> I based the logic in my program on how I convert binary by hand.
If I were to do this again, I would probably research more efficient ways to calculate this.

**How to Run**:

- Compile `lab2p2.c` using gcc
  - Example command: `gcc lab2p2.c -o lap2p2`
- Run in terminal

## Part 3

**Total Time Spent** : 2 hour

**Notes**:
>In implementing my solution I used some of the string methods provided in the `<string.h>` header file, to compare and check if certain characters were alphanumeric.

**How to Run**:

- Compile `lab2p3.c` using gcc
  - Example command: `gcc lab2p3.c -o lap2p3`
- Run in terminal

## Part 4

**Total Time Spent** : 3 hours

**Notes**:
>I had alot of trouble getting the nodes in the linked list to instantiate properly. I realised I had to use mallaoc to create a space of memory that would still be accessable after the function call.
Otherwise, the pointer logic was pretty intuitive.

**How to Run**:

- Compile `lab2p4.c` using gcc
  - Example command: `gcc lab2p4.c -o lap4p2`
- Run in terminal
  - Example command: `./lab2p4.c This is A Test example`
